# TOP 7 -  Short problem description 
Develop a program to manage a chart of hits where songs are voted on, numbered from 1 to 99999999. The program reads commands from standard input: "NEW MAX" for starting a new chart, and "TOP" for summarizing rankings. Songs with the same votes/points are ranked by their lower number. The program verifies input data and reports errors.
